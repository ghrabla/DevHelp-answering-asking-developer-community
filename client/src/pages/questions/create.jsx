                    <p class="mb-4">This is where you can design and customize your own set of questions for your survey, quiz, or any other application that requires user input.</p>

                            To get started, think about the purpose of your questions. Are you trying to gather information, test knowledge, or simply engage your audience? Once you have a clear objective in mind, you can begin crafting your questions.

                        <li class="p-2 rounded-lg">

                            Some tips for creating effective questions include being clear and concise, avoiding ambiguity, and using simple language. You may also want to consider using a mix of question types, such as multiple-choice, open-ended, or rating scales, to capture different types of data.
                        </li>
                        <li class="p-2 rounded-lg">
                            <i class="fas fa-users mr-2"></i>
                            When designing your questions, think about your target audience and tailor your language and tone accordingly. You want your questions to be relevant and engaging to your audience, and to encourage them to provide honest and thoughtful responses.
                        </li>
                        <li class="p-2 rounded-lg">
                            <i class="fas fa-check-circle mr-2"></i>
                            Once you have created your questions, be sure to test them out to ensure they are effective and easy to understand. You may also want to consider conducting a pilot study with a small group of people to gather feedback and refine your questions before using them on a larger scale.
